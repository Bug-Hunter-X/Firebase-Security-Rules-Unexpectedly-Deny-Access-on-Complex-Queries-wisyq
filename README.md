# Firebase Security Rules Bug: Unexpected Access Denial on Complex Queries

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when using complex queries with nested data in Firebase Realtime Database security rules. Even when the logical conditions within the security rules appear correct, access may be unexpectedly denied.

The bug is particularly prevalent with arrays of objects, requiring careful traversal and condition checking within the security rules.  The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problematic scenario, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Firebase project and configure the database rules accordingly. The rules are defined within the source code. 
3. Run `firebaseBug.js`. You should observe an access denied error. 
4. Then run `firebaseBugSolution.js`. You should observe successful data access. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully restructuring the security rules to ensure that all access conditions are correctly evaluated and that nested objects and arrays are handled with appropriate iteration mechanisms within the rule's logic. This typically requires a more granular and explicit approach to checking the conditions and avoiding implicit assumption.  Details are presented in the `firebaseBugSolution.js` file.
